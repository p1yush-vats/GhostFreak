            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings! I'm Piyush Vats, currently enrolled in the BCA program at IITM Janakpuri, which is
                affiliated with Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (IPU).
            <p>
                My academic journey includes achieving a commendable 90% in my 12th-grade exams, and now I'm immersed
                in BCA studies. Alongside my academic pursuits, I harbor a deep passion for programming. I've honed my
                skills in technical communication, C, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the classroom, I actively engage in extracurricular activities such as coding competitions,
                hackathons, and volunteering, which enrich my overall learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, learning is a continuous process, and I thrive on exploring new technologies to expand my skill
                set. I'm eagerly looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills to make meaningful contributions to
                the tech industry.
            </p>
